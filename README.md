# Hi, I'm Andrés 👋

I'm a **Computer Engineer** with a strong academic background in **Machine Learning** and **Statistics**, and a particular interest in turning statistical ideas into efficient, usable software.

* 🎓 **Computer Engineering** — Universidad de la República (Montevideo, Uruguay)
* 📊 **BSc in Statistics for Technology** — Universidad de la República (finishing)
* 🧠 Academic focus on **statistical learning**, **machine learning algorithms**, **mathematical modelling**, and their theoretical foundations
* ⚙️ Currently developing a **high-performance C++ implementation of Projection Pursuit Random Forests**, designed to be used as an **R package**
* 💼 **6+ years of professional experience** in industry at Wyeworks, working across frontend and backend systems (mostly TypeScript-based stacks)

While most of my industry experience is in full-stack development, my main interests lie in **algorithmic development**, **ML systems**, and **performance-critical code**, closer to research and systems-oriented engineering.
